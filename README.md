## Installing
First, clone the repo:
```bash
https://github.com/lucasfrosty/lucasfrosty.github.io.git
```

This is already enough if you don't want any gulp feature like sass compiler, minifier, etc. But if you need it, follow the instructions below.

Install the necessary npm modules into the project:
```bash
npm install
```

Now, you'll need to start ``gulp``, to do that, just type in your terminal:
```bash
npm run start
```
This will initiate some automation process:
1. A live server (on localhost:3000)
2. SASS Compiler (with autoprefixer)
3. CSS, JS and Image Minifier

See the ``gulpfile.js`` to see the config file.
